# test_hooks

Simple test about new hooks feature (React v16.7)

App boostraped by create-react-app

## Description

An app to learn how to use hooks.

It uses basic hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
`useReducer` is like `useState` but you have to use it for complex state update.

It also compares perfomances between 'component based' React and 'hooks based' React through a ToDo app.

I have one question : What are use cases for useCallback and useMemo ?

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

# Start application

```bash
yarn start
```
